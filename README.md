Physical computing aspects of anyWare (firmware, electronics)

## arduino

The Arduino sketched share some common code.
However, there are no good mechanism for sharing code when using the IDE.

Our workaround for now is to keep shared code in the common/ folder
and copy the files from there into each sketch folder.
Not nice, but the result is self-contained sketches.

### Test sketches

These are just for hardware testing

### Test games

These are basic self-contained game sketches, for playtesting in isolation
